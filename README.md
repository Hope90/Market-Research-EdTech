# Market-Research-EdTech
## Project context:

You are invited to a meeting about the company's international expansion project. Your manager entrusts you with an initial exploratory analysis mission, to determine whether the World Bank's education data can inform the expansion project.
(World Bank data is available at: https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/education-statistics)

Here are the different questions your manager would like to explore, which you noted during the meeting:

Which countries have high customer potential for our services?

For each of these countries, what will be the evolution of this customer potential?

In which countries should the company operate as a priority?
